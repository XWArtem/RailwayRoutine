The main idea is:
A player collects true items and raises the score. If he hits the bomb, the game ends. If he misses a certain amount of true items, the game ends
There must be a bar of missed items which fulls as the player misses items

The speed increases smoothly during the game
After a certain amount of time some trash vagons start to spawn, they should be clicked many times to open. Those are armored vagons which can contain bombs or items.
Higher the speed - more rewards for each resource

There is a score global leadership

Settings: sounds on/off, music on/off, player name, feedback

Buttons on main menu: Play, settings, exit. Leadership on the top of screen
